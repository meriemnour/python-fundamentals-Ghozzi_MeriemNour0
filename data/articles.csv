2511.09630;"Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: I. Resonant Conversions in Halos";"Mixing between dark photons and visible photons leads to substantial anisotropies in the cosass between  and  eV and kinetic mixing parameter  as small as  by cross-correlating on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in . This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.";"data/papers/2510.2511.09630v1.pdf";"Ethan Baker";"professor"
2511.09649;"The origin of scatter in the X-ray luminosity - halo mass relation of galaxy clusters";"Galaxy groups and clusters are excellent probes of large-scale structure and are shaped by some of the most energetic physical processes in the Universe. They follow a tight scaling relation of X-ray luminosity with halo mass. However, predicting the dependence of the scatter in this relation on mass and redshift is challenging, due to the statistical requirement of large simulation volumes.

2511.09706;"Towards a Machine Learning Solution for Hubble Tension: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Analysis of Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy in Presence of Neutrinos";"We present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for reconstructing the redshift-dependent Hubble parameter \(H(z)\) within the Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (THDE) model extended by massive neutrinos.
